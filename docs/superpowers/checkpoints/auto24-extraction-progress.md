# Auto24 extraction service checkpoints

## Task 1: Package, URL rules, and response contract

- Status: complete
- Start: 2026-09-26 23:30 UTC (approximate delegation time)
- End: 2026-09-26 23:40 UTC (commit completed at 23:40:23 UTC)
- Elapsed: about 10 minutes
- Added nonblank source, test, and configuration lines: 187
- RED: both requested test modules failed collection because `auto24_service` did not exist.
- GREEN: focused contract tests passed (13); full available suite passed (13).
- Environment: host Python lacked pytest and Pydantic and could not reach the package index. Docker worked with escalation; dependencies were installed in a disposable container.
- Commit: recorded in the Task 1 report.
